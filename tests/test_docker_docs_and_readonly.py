"""Regression tests for the Docker docs+readonly hygiene PR (post v0.51.83).

Pins three invariants:

1. The `hermes-agent-src` named volume is mounted READ-ONLY on the WebUI
   service in both multi-container compose files. The WebUI only reads it to
   install agent Python deps at startup; this is defence-in-depth against a
   compromised WebUI writing into the agent's source tree (Concern raised by
   RustyLopez on #2453 and #1416).

2. The workspace bind-mount default uses `${HOME}/workspace` (not `~/workspace`)
   in both multi-container compose files, matching the single-container
   convention so `~`/`${HOME}` doesn't disagree across Linux, macOS, WSL2, and
   Docker Desktop on Windows.

3. `docs/docker.md` documents the agent-image upgrade procedure (`docker volume
   rm hermes-agent-src`) — the root cause of #1416.
