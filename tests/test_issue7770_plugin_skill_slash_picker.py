"""#7770 (commands.js): plugin-registered skills must round-trip through the
slash-command autocomplete and the ``/use`` sub-arg picker.

The picker builds its command entries from ``/api/skills``. Before the fix:

* ``_skillCommandSlug('superpowers:brainstorming')`` stripped ``:`` and
  produced ``superpowersbrainstorming``, so the entry the user clicked had
  no resolvable path back to the qualified name returned by the endpoint.
* The picker had no way to label a plugin skill distinctly, so a
  ``superpowers:*`` row looked identical to a directory-installed skill.

The fix keeps ``:`` in the slug (lossless round-trip) and tags the entry
with the plugin namespace so the description can say ``Plugin: superpowers``
when the qualified name is not already prefixed with the namespace.

The tests below run the real ``static/commands.js`` in a node ``vm`` with a
mocked ``/api/skills`` payload — the same harness style as
``test_issue7509_disabled_skills_slash_picker.py``. They pin:

* the slug of a qualified name preserves the colon;
* the autocomplete shows the qualified-name entry when the user types the
  namespace prefix (``/super``);
* the ``/use super`` sub-arg list includes the qualified names so users can
  force a plugin skill for the next turn;
* the picker entry carries ``source: 'skill'`` AND a ``plugin`` namespace so
  the UI can render a plugin hint.
